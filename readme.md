# [bhackel Projects](https://bhackel.github.io/portfolio/)

This repo contains documentation/links to all relevant projects that I have worked on.

The purpose of this repo is to make it easier for employers to view my work.


## [Automated Homework Grading System](dsc20-style-checker.md)
I tutor for an introductory Python programming class. This project reduced the grading time of homework by around 90% by eliminating the need for tutors to manually grade coding style. See details [here](dsc20-style-checker.md)

## [Gym Tracker Project](cse191.md)

This class project involved placing around 25 ESP32 microcontrollers in various places at the school gym to determine which locations were most active. We used Bluetooth Low Energy MAC addresses and RSSI values to determine distance from the device. See details [here](cse191.md)
