Back in high school, I was watching a lot of YouTube videos about neural networks, specifically from Carykh. Based on those videos, I decided at some point to create my own demonstration of the progression of a recurrent neural network during training. I am not entirely sure why I wanted to make a video, but it was a fun exercise in running a machine learning model locally using CUDA.
