## The Final Version

This iteration uses my first custom designed PCB to house all components together. Although it is very simple, practicing PCB design will allow me to pursue more ambitious PCB-based projects in the future. Another benefit is the reduced case size by a few millimeters, which solves a clearance issue with the camera from the previous iteration.

## Next Ambitions

With this project done, I want to pursue more interesting projects like my Water Softener Automation idea.

## Issues Faced

You may notice the PCB is cut at the corners. This is because I did not account for the rounded corners in my CAD when designing the PCB. Because the case's design is higher priority, I used cutters to snip off the PCB edges.
